NAME
    badsector - find and relocate unused bad sectors in ext filesystem

SYNOPSIS
      badsector [options] <harddisk device> <PROBLEM_LBA>

DESCRIPTION
    Implement the algorithm described in STANDARDS section for the ext[2-4]
    partitions only.

    The *smarmontools* can report problematic bad sectors in LBA addressing
    format. This program takes LBA address that smartmaontools reports as
    bad and relocates the sector provided that it is unused.

    However, if the sector contains data, there is nothing that can be done.
    This program is no "spinrite" and is not cabable reading damaged data.

OPTIONS
    -a, --auto
        Use dd(1) to force relocating unused lba error block. Use at your
        own risk.

    -r, --read
        Try reading PROBLEM_LBA with dd(1). If bad, this might relocate a
        bad sector in modern harddisks.

    -t, --test
        Do not really do actions instructed by option --auto, but show
        commands that would be run.

    -h, --help
        Display this help and exit

    -V, --version
        Output version information and exit.

EXAMPLES
    Run disk test on harddisk and look at the results:

        smartctl -t short /dev/sda
        smartctl -l selftest /dev/sda
        smartctl -l error -q errorsonly /dev/sda
        smartctl -A /dev/sda

    After "smartctl -t short /dev/sda" has finished, pick the LBA value from
    the output. The last test run is always at the top:

        $ smartctl -l selftest /dev/sda
        Num  Test_Description  Status        Remaining  LifeTime(hours)  LBA_of_first_error
        1  Extended offline    read failure  90%        217              0x016561e9

    Try to relocate this bad sector:

        badsector --auto [--test] /dev/sda 0x016561e9

ENVIRONMENT
    None.

FILES
    None.
