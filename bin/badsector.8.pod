=head1 NAME

badsector - find and relocate unused bad sectors in ext filesystem

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  badsector [options] <harddisk device> <PROBLEM_LBA>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implement the algorithm described in STANDARDS section for the
ext[2-4] partitions only.

The I<smarmontools> can report problematic bad sectors in LBA
addressing format. This program takes LBA address that smartmaontools
reports as bad and relocates the sector provided that it is unused.

However, if the sector contains data, there is nothing that can be
done. This program is no "spinrite" and is not cabable reading damaged
data.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-a, --auto>

Use dd(1) to force relocating unused lba error block. Use at your own
risk.

=item B<-r, --read>

Try reading PROBLEM_LBA with dd(1). If bad, this might relocate a bad sector
in modern harddisks.

=item B<-t, --test>

Do not really do actions instructed by option B<--auto>, but show
commands that would be run.

=item B<-h, --help>

Display this help and exit

=item B<-V, --version>

Output version information and exit.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Run disk test on harddisk and look at the results:

    smartctl -t short /dev/sda
    smartctl -l selftest /dev/sda
    smartctl -l error -q errorsonly /dev/sda
    smartctl -A /dev/sda

After C<smartctl -t short /dev/sda> has finished, pick the LBA value
from the output. The last test run is always at the top:

    $ smartctl -l selftest /dev/sda
    Num  Test_Description  Status        Remaining  LifeTime(hours)  LBA_of_first_error
    1  Extended offline    read failure  90%        217              0x016561e9

Try to relocate this bad sector:

    badsector --auto [--test] /dev/sda 0x016561e9

=head1 ENVIRONMENT
